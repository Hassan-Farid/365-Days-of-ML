    "# Near Duplicates:\n",
    "Near Duplicates or Fuzzy Duplicates are a commonly arising problem in the process of deduplication. It refers to the set of those partial or full duplicates, that are slightly disimilar to their corressponding records but carry the same context i.e. these duplicates represent the same record (since they are duplicates) but have slight differences in their naming e.g. due to typos. misspellings, grammatical errors, synonyms, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Causes for Near Duplicates:\n",
    "Near Duplicates are a frequently occurring problem in Machine Learning datasets as it happens to be the case, there are many reasons for near duplicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Entry Errors:\n",
    "The most common of the bunch in cases of machine learning tasks are data entry errors i.e. the value for the data entered has some typos or misspellings induced in it by the entry person or machine. Example of this case might be entering the record \"Jane\" instead of \"Jone\" for a student table, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Entries:\n",
    "Another case of this can be a dataset being filled up by multiple people or groups at the same time. This results in each person or group saving the entries as per their set of information and may result in near duplicate entries. Example of this case might be two entry operators entering the records \"John Smith\" and \"Jon Smith\" for a student table, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Translation:\n",
    "Near duplicates may also be the result of translation of one language to another. Example of this case is are the words \"Good Morning\" if converted to Japense translate to \"Ohay≈ç\", which are different in syntax but represent the same context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plagirism:\n",
    "Another root cause of near duplicates is plagirism when generating content or data. This is frequent in content writing, critic reviews, news articles, school assignments, etc. For example, one critic may copy some other critic's lines and mix it with his own to create his review on a particular book, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removal of Near Duplicates:\n",
    "The process of removing near duplicates and identifying the records that represent the same real world entity is referred to as \"Entity Recognition\" or simply \"Record Linkage\". Since near duplicates are deemed as a very important issue in terms of machine learning, due to their effect on the efficiency of the models, many different techniques have been proposed to remove them from a given dataset. Each technique is based on the set of requirements for the given problem and can supposedly be distributed into two phases i.e. prepartion and similarity measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation Phase:\n",
    "In this phase, different types of techniques are used to prepare the data so as to perform similarity metrics on the records. The goal of data preparation phase is to use the data format required in accordance with the given problem and improvise the process of record linkage. Data preparation phase itself can be divided into two sub-phases i.e. preprocessing and extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing Phase:\n",
    "In this phase, the data is preprocessed so as to obtain an efficient format of data to generate relevant features from given variables to get an effective result for near duplicates. There are many data preprocessing techniques that can be used for this case, some of these are as follows:\n",

    "Tf-Idf (Term-Frequency Inverse-Document-Frequency) Vectorization is a technique that is used to map text into numerical vectors and can be utilized to detect near duplicate records. The vectorization process works by representing each record/document as a vector of Tf-Idf values which are computed by taking the product of the term frequency (number of occurrences of a term) and its inverse document frequency (measure of rarity of the term in the records/documents). Thus, this allows us to compare the similarity between the Tf-Idf vectors obtained for given records, which can tell us whether the records are near duplicates or not.\n",
